# Transparency and Information Provision

## User Notification
Users interacting with this system must be informed that they are using an AI system.

### Implementation
*   **Login Banner:** Upon session start, the system displays: "Governance Layer Active: Session Audited."
*   **Metadata:** API responses include model version and configuration parameters (logged in audit trail).

## Limitations
*   The system may generate incorrect or biased code.
*   The system should not be used for final decision-making in high-risk contexts without human review.
*   The PII filter is rule-based and may not catch all sensitive data.

## Explanability
*   Users can request the "reasoning" behind a governance block by reviewing the audit logs or contacting the AI System Owner.
